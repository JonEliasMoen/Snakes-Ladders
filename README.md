# Snakes-Ladders
This project requires you to create a Snakes & Ladders game, similar to the one shown in the image below, with the following set of rules. 

 

Snakes and ladders | LearnEnglish Kids | British Council

Rules

    It’ll be a two-player game.

    Each player’s token (piece) is positioned at the first location at the start of a new game. 

    A player takes a turn rolling a dice. 

    Each player rolls two dice at a time at each turn. 

    A player’s token (piece) moves to the new position by taking steps equal to the sum of dice outcomes. 

    If the number on both dice is the same, the same player takes another turn.  

    If a player token (piece) falls on the first ladder step, the player token (piece) will move up the ladder to a new position ONLY when the position it lands on is clicked. 

    If a player token (piece) falls on the snakehead, the player’s piece moves down to the new position ONLY when the position it lands on (i.e., snakehead block) is clicked.

    A player cannot move a token (piece) if the value on dice rolls is greater than the steps required to land on the "finish" block. The turn is given to the other player. 

    The player who lands on the last block wins the game. 

 

GUI

    Create a GUI Interface for the game using Swing. 

    Launch the game from the Game Center created in Task-3. 

    Your interface should contain 36 blocks – label and color them as you like. 1st block is the start while the last block is finish. 

    The interface has a minimum of 2 snakes and 2 ladders. Position head and tail of snake and ladder as you please on the blocks. 

    It should also have an option to start a new game, a restart/reset option which will reposition the player’s pieces to the first block and clear all temporary variables, and an exit button. 

    The dice output from both dice is displayed on the screen after each roll. 

    A player’s token (piece) should be visible on the board block. It should appear on the block (move) based on dice value.  

 

The GUI is at your disposal. Be as creative as you like. You are allowed to work in groups as far as building game logic, however, since it’s an individual task and will be graded individually, it is expected that the game GUI is customized by each individual within the same group. Each student will have to give a demo of the project for grading. 

Extras/Optional

    A player should be able to enter his/her name before the game starts. 

    A player can choose between different colors/types of tokens (pieces) i.e., a basic pawn shape (red/blue/green/yellow), a car, a horse.

    A player can resign a game. The other player will win in that case. 

    A MENU bar with the following functionalities:

        File  new game, reset, resign, exit. 

        Help  How to play / instructions

        About  Game version, author

 

To Submit

    Source code .java files

    An executable .jar file 

 

Individual submission

            Each student should individually submit the Project-1 for grading. You can upload the task multiple times (3 as of now) before the deadline. Your final submission will be graded. 

 

Deadline

            Friday, 2nd October 2020 – 11:30 pm

 

Marks/Grade

It’s a graded assignment that carries 10% marks to the final grade. Both submission and demo (presentation) will contribute to the grading. 

 

Grading Scheme

            A >= 90            B >= 80            C >= 70               D >= 55            E >= 40            F < 40
